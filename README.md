# QuickBuntu — Ubuntu Post-Installation Guide

**QuickBuntu** is a comprehensive post-installation setup for developers who use Ubuntu as their primary operating system.

It automates the configuration of a powerful, modern, and secure development environment — installing programming languages, IDEs, productivity tools, and system enhancements — all optimized to improve efficiency, performance, and daily workflow reliability.

Follow these steps in order to transform a fresh Ubuntu installation into a ready-to-code workstation.

* * *

## 1. Navigate to the Home Directory

Before executing any setup commands, it's recommended to begin from your home directory. This ensures that files, logs, and configurations are stored consistently in user-specific paths rather than system-wide directories. Starting in `$HOME` guarantees that subsequent relative paths used throughout the guide resolve correctly, simplifying maintenance later.

```bash
cd $HOME
```

* * *

## 2. Disable Apport

First thing to do is check your `/var/crash` directory and see if there are any “crash” files. These are just normal text files and include details about a process. If you have a process crashing regularly, you most likely want to report it, so the vendor can implement a fix.

```bash
ls -la /var/crash
sudo rm -f /var/*.crash
sudo sed -i 's/^enabled=1/enabled=0/' /etc/default/apport
```

* * *

## 3. Update and Clean the System

A complete system update and cleanup is critical before installing new software. This process ensures you're working with the latest security patches, kernel improvements, and dependency versions available in Ubuntu's repositories. By cleaning and removing unused packages, you also free disk space and prevent version conflicts during the installation of future tools.

```bash
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade
sudo apt -y remove && sudo apt -y autoremove
sudo apt -y clean && sudo apt -y autoclean
```

* * *

## 4. Remove Unused Default Applications (Thunderbird)

Many Ubuntu distributions include pre-installed applications that may not be necessary for developers. For example, **Thunderbird** is an email client that occupies space and system resources if unused. Removing such applications helps streamline the environment, reduces update time, and improves startup performance by avoiding unnecessary background services.

```bash
sudo snap list
sudo snap remove --purge thunderbird
```

* * *

## 5. Install Essential System Libraries

These libraries provide the foundational components required to build, compile, and run modern software. Libraries like `libclang-dev`, `libssl-dev`, and `zlib1g-dev` are dependencies for compilers, encryption, and compression operations used in C/C++, Python, and Rust projects. Installing them early avoids compilation errors when setting up more advanced developer tools later.

```bash
sudo apt -y install libclang-dev libffi-dev libfuse2 libgl1 libssl-dev libudev-dev libxcb-cursor0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 zlib1g-dev
```

* * *

## 6. Install Developer Fonts

Readable fonts are essential for long coding sessions. Installing **DejaVu** and **Powerline** fonts ensures compatibility with customized terminal prompts, syntax-highlighted themes, and tools like `Oh My Zsh`. They enhance the visual clarity of code, improve readability of symbols, and make special Powerline icons display properly in terminals and IDEs.

```bash
sudo apt -y install fonts-dejavu fonts-powerline 
```

* * *

## 7. Install Core Developer Packages

This step equips your system with a wide range of developer utilities and productivity tools. From compilers (`build-essential`) to network analysis utilities (`nmap`, `wfuzz`, `nikto`), this set ensures your workstation can handle web development, cybersecurity tasks, and general system maintenance. Having them pre-installed means less downtime when switching between project types or debugging different environments.

```bash
sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https build-essential ca-certificates curl deborphan dirb dnsenum easytag evolution evolution-ews exiftool ffmpeg \
filezilla flatpak gimp git golang gnome-tweaks hashcat httrack hydra inkscape john kdenlive net-tools nikto nmap policykit-1 pkg-config protobuf-compiler \
secure-delete shutter software-properties-common sqlitebrowser sqlmap subversion testssl.sh trash-cli wapiti wfuzz wget whatweb whois zsh
```

* * *

## 8. Install Python and Related Packages

Python is essential for automation, data analysis, scripting, and backend web development. This step installs Python 3 along with scientific and web development libraries such as **NumPy**, **Flask**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. Symbolic links for `python` and `pip` are also added for command-line convenience, ensuring compatibility with older scripts expecting the `python` binary name.

```bash
sudo apt -y install python3 python3-bs4 python3-cryptography python3-dateutil python3-dev python3-django python3-flask python3-ipython \
python3-jinja2 python3-lxml python3-matplotlib python3-numpy python3-pandas python3-pip python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt6 python3-requests \
python3-scipy python3-setuptools python3-sklearn python3-venv
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/local/bin/pip
```

* * *

## 9. Install Java Runtime and Development Kit

Java remains a foundational technology for enterprise, Android, and cross-platform applications. Installing both **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** and **JDK (Java Development Kit)** provides the ability to compile and run Java programs. Many IDEs, including JetBrains products, rely on these components to function properly.

```bash
